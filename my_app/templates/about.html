<h1>About the Art Collector</h1>
<hr />

<p class="page-content">
    The art collector is a resource created for students of the Evolve Artist Program. 
    The last block of study is Master Copy. Due to my limited education in master copy painting, 
    I wanted a place to collect artworks I come across, as well as other students' work, in Block 8.
